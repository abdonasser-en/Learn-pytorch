A research deep learning framework developed by Meta, PyTorch is an open-source platform used by big companies such as Tesla and Microsoft. One of the most interesting aspects of PyTorch is that it offers plenty of pre-built learning models hosted on their website( you can can find TorchHub [here](https://pytorch.org/hub/)).

PyTorch provides a wide range of tools that cater to the machine learning life cycle, including data preprocessing, model development, and model deployment..
